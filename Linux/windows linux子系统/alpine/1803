==== MANUAL STEP ====
If you're on Windows 10 1803 17134, manually execute this/these command(s), NOW:
Or upgrade to the latest version of windows 10
/bin/chmod 755 /
/sbin/apk --no-cache add shadow
/bin/sed -i 's/^export PATH/#export PATH/' /etc/profile

Also you need to provide a /bin/bash executable to use bash.exe from Windows.
Either by symlinking any other shell to /bin/bash or by installing bash.
If you want to change the default user (after you created one), run:
Alpine.exe /config --default-user <username>
== // MANUAL STEP // ==

apk update && apk add bash shadow && chmod 755 /
adduser -g '' -D %username%
usermod -aG adm,floppy,cdrom,tape,wheel,ping %username%
and after that run the following in windows:
Alpine.exe configure --default-user %username%
