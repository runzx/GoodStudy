Getting OpenLayers
------------------

OpenLayers lives at http://www.openlayers.org/.

You can get OpenLayers from
    http://trac.openlayers.org/wiki/HowToDownload.

---------------------
Installing OpenLayers
---------------------

You can use OpenLayers as-is by copying build/OpenLayers.js and the
entire lib/ directory up to your webserver, putting them in the same
directory. To include the OpenLayers library in your web page, use:

  <script type="text/javascript" src="OpenLayers.js" />

If you want to use the multiple-file version of OpenLayers (for, say,
debugging or development purposes), copy the lib/ directory up to your
webserver in the same directory you put the img/ folder. Then add
the following to your web page instead:

  <script type="text/javascript" src="lib/OpenLayers.js" />

------------------------------------
Using OpenLayers in Your Own Website
------------------------------------

The examples/ directory is full of useful examples.

There is some documentation at http://trac.openlayers.org/ as well.
