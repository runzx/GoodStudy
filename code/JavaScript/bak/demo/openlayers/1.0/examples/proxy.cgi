"""This is a blind proxy that we use to get around browser
restrictions that prevent the Javascript from loading pages not on the
same server as the Javascript.  This has several problems: it's less
efficient, it might break some sites, and it's a security risk because
people can use this proxy to browse the web and possibly do bad stuff
with it.  If you can get your code signed (see:
http://trac.openlayers.org/wiki/HowToSignJavascript), then you should
modify Parameters.js so that this isn't used.  Otherwise, you're stuck
with it.  It only loads pages via http and https, but it can load any
content type. XML and HTML are both currently used by Openlayers."""
