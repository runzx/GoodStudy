Scrapy runs on Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 or above.

If you’re using Anaconda or Miniconda, you can install the package from the conda-forge channel, which has up-to-date packages for Linux, Windows and OS X.
    To install Scrapy using conda, run:
        conda install -c conda-forge scrapy
Alternatively, if you’re already familiar with installation of Python packages, you can install Scrapy and its dependencies from PyPI with:
    pip install Scrapy
