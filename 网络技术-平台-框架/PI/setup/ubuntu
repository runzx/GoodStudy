Insert your SD card or USB flash drive

Identify its address by opening the "Disks" application and look for the "Device" line. 
  If the line is in the /dev/mmcblk0p1 format, then your 
    drive address is: /dev/mmcblk0 
  If it is in the /dev/sdb1 format, then the address is /dev/sdb

Unmount it by right-clicking its icon in the launcher bar, the eject icon in a file manager or the square icon in the "Disks" application

Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) to copy the image to your removable drive

If the Ubuntu image file you have downloaded ends with an `.xz` file extension, run:
  xzcat ~/Downloads/<image-file.xz> | sudo dd of=<drive address> bs=32M

Else, run:
  sudo dd if=~/Downloads/<image-file> of=<drive address> bs=32M

Then, run the sync command to finalize the process

You can now eject your removable drive. You are ready to install Ubuntu on your device â€º
